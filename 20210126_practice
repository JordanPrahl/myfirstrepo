## Filtering exercise from class on January 19, 2021
## In this exercise, we are provided access to a VCF file, which we copy to our own directories and manipulate. 
## We practice viewing, QCing, and filtering VCF files using commands such as grep, wc, zcat, & cut.

# First we log into the VAI HPC and copy our data over to our own directory
