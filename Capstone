## Introduction
For my capstone project, I have chosen to generate a heatmap of my re-analyzed data. I am comparing RNAseq data from my rs356182-lesion clones to several wildtype controls (both differentiated and undifferentiated). Previously, I was using results generated by Steve Pierce to generate figures and do comparisons, but we decided some of the samples didn't make sense to include anymore. I chose to re-perform the analysis from scratch using only the relavent fastq sample files.Samples needed to be unpacked, have the adapters trimmed off, be aligned to a reference genome, and output a reads/gene count file. This was done in several steps. The presence of both single end and paired-end data made the analysis more complicated.
